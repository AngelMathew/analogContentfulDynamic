# Analog App

This project was generated with [Analog](https://analogjs.org), the fullstack meta-framework for Angular.
Using this app we can dynamically specify what components to render based on data from Contentful.

1. Get content data from Contentful.
2. Map content models in Contentful to components in FE.
3. Build components in FE to display the content.
